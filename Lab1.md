These are my screenshots 
ls outside of a directory with no arguments lists folders/directories in my workspace

ls with the directory as the argument lists the available files  

ls with the file as the argument says that it isn't a file or repository


cd outside of a directory with no arguments "/home" does nothing 
cd in a directory with no arguments takes me out of the directory 

cd with an argument of folder/directory takes me to a directory

cd with an argument file tells me that it's not a directory 

cat with no arguments returns a nothing as we are in no directory 



This is my Markdowns
