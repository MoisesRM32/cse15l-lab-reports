1. The `ls` command lists the `lecture1` directory. The current directory was `home` directory
2. The output of the directory was `Lecture1`
3. `ls` outside of a directory when used with no arguments, lists the files and directories in the current working directory

1. The `ls` in the folder `Lecture1` lists `Hello.java`, `Hello.class`, `Messages`, and `README`
2. The output of the directory was `Hello.java`, `Hello.class`, `Messages`, and `README`
3. `ls` with a directory as the argument lists the files and directories within that specified directory.

1. Now going to use the `ls` in the file `ga.txt` 
2. `ls` within the file `ga.txt` gave me an error stating that it is not a directory
3. `ls` with the file as the argument says that it isn't a file or repository. 
   Basically saying that it returns an error message stating that the specified file is not a directory.

1. Using `cd` with no arguments at the `home` directory 
2. The output was nothing or returning to the previous directory if in one 
3. Cd outside of a directory with no arguments `/home` does nothing 
   `cd` in a directory with no arguments takes me out of the directory

1. `Cd` with the argument `lecture1` of folder/directory takes me to a directory
2. The output of this command took me to the directory `lecture1`
3. `Cd` with a folder as the argument will change the current directory to the folder

1. `Cd` with the argument of the file `Hello.java`
2. The output of the command causes an error stating that it is not a directory/folder
3. `Cd` with an argument file tells me that it's not a directory because the file is not a parent

1. I wrote the command `cat` with no arguments in the `home` directory
2. The output was that we were able to write in the terminal and nothing happens 
3. `Cat` with no arguments returns a nothing as we are in no directory but allows us to write in the terminal output
   (also found out that pressing `Ctrl` and `C` takes you out of the cat)

1. I used the `cat` command with the argument `lecture1` 
2. `cat` with an argument of a folder/directory will state that it's a folder/directory and `cat` doesn't print the name `'lecture1'`
3. The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files and it doesn't work on directories.

1. I used the `cat` command on the `en-us.txt` file to display its contents
2. The output of this command was that it displayed the words "Hello World!"
3.` cat` with an argument of a file will state the contents in the file (But must be in the right directory with the right file to do so)
